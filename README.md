# 👋 Hi, I’m Dharun Kumar

I'm a Master's student in Systems, Control and Mechatronics (Autonomous Systems track) at Chalmers University of Technology, passionate about the software side of autonomous systems—how smart machines learn, adapt, and interact in real-world environments.

I specialize in machine learning, computer vision, control algorithms, and embedded programming. Through projects, coursework, internships, research roles, and competitions, I've gained hands-on experience with tools like PyTorch, OpenCV, ROS2, C/C++, Python, FreeRTOS, STM32, Docker, GitHub Actions, and Prefect. Highlights include:

- Developing data-driven models for welding arc prediction at ESAB (thesis: computer vision annotation to camera-free time-series forecasting, improving process control).
- Building flight controller software for EUROC 2026 rocket (CAESAR: CI/CD, state machines, GUI).
- Fusing LiDAR/camera data with Kalman filters (Udacity Nanodegree: Waymo dataset tracking).
- Integrating LLMs with robots for HRI studies (Chalmers: Google Gemini, proxemics analysis).
- Boosting robot navigation success from 34% to 56% via adversarial RL and MPC.

I'm also keen on software best practices, testing, and building inclusive tools—like those supporting people with disabilities through robotics.

Beyond tech, I volunteer as an Intize mentor teaching gifted students advanced math, and train in Swedish Jiu-Jitsu for discipline and fitness.

Open to summer internships, entry-level/graduate roles in embedded systems, ML, or control engineering, and open-source contributions. Eligible for Swedish post-study work permit (available full-time summer 2026).
